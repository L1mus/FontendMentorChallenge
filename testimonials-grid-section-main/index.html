          "I was an EMT for many year before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have
          heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
          incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of
          my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, worinking as a Software Engineer
          at a Vr startup"

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed sine structured from professionals
          who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll ny a former student of theirs who
          can only say wondefull things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
          were very hand-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile tean project, in particular, was
          outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          oftten referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent eexperience, it certainly helped me
          land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offer. 100% recommended."
